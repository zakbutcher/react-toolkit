# Creating a Brand Identity

Now that you have a palette, how do you mix & match the colors to create a theme or brand identity? Color harmonies help isolate individual colors for us as we establish the traditional palette names like "Brand Primary" or "Accent 1".

## Complimentary

Complimentary color schemes provide a simple, two-color, high-contrast color theme that works well for small UI elements

## Analogous

Analogous color schemes generally use 3 adjacent colors to create a near-monochromatic palette. Analogous color schemes are generally low contrast and require extra care when using to ensure users can easily discern the differences between each color in the palette.

## Triadic

Triadic color schemes consist of 3 equally spaced colors; e.g. RGB, CMY, etc. These themes can be extremely jarring for users when overdone. It's important to remember the 60/30/10 rule if this harmony is used.

## Split Complimentary

Split Complimentary color schemes take a base Complimentary scheme and replace one complimentary color with that color's two adjacent (or analogous) colors. For example, Red's complimentary color is Cyan. Cyan forms an analogous color scheme with Spring Green & Azure.

A Split Complimentary color palette with a Red base will have Spring Green & Azure as the second & third colors in the set.

## Tetradic

Tetradic color schemes consist of 4 colors and are normally formed using two pairs of complimentary colors. Because complimentary color palettes provide such strong contrast, having two pairs of complimentary colors can result in overwhelming user experiences. When using a tetradic scheme, one color should serve as the primary and the others should be used as accents.
