# Color in the Physical World

In the physical world (e.g. mixing pigments to make colored paint) color is defined in the Red Yellow Blue (RYB) color space. This means the 3 primary colors are: Red, Yellow, & Blue.

In the RYB color space, mixing two primary colors yields a Secondary color. Red + Yellow results in Orange, Yellow + Blue yields green, and Blue + Red creates Purple.

Finally, Tertiary colors are created by combining one Primary & one Secondary:

- Vermillion - Red + Orange
- Amber - Yellow + Orange
- Chartreuse - Yellow + Green
- Teal - Blue + Green
- Violet - Blue + Purple
- Magenta - Red + Purple

For the context of this presentation, we'll be leveraging a 12-color palette across all color spaces we discuss: 3 Primary, 3 Secondary, & 6 Tertiary colors

# Color in the Digital World

In digital mediums (including print!) the Red Green Blue (RGB) color space is more popular and allows us to create roughly the same colors that exist in nature.

Primary Colors:

- Red
- Green
- Blue

Secondary Colors:

- Yellow (Red + Green)
- Cyan (Green + Blue)
- Magenta (Blue + Red)

Tertiary Colors:

- Orange - Red + Yellow
- Chartreuse - Green + Yellow
- Spring Green - Green + Cyan
- Azure - Blue + Cyan
- Violet - Blue + Magenta
- Rose - Red + Magenta

# Physical v Digital

Both color spaces are valid. RGB is easier to use in a digital environment. The most important takeaway is to be consistent in your color space. Others exist (HSL, CMYK, NTSC, HSV, etc) and serve specific use-cases.
